🎉 Meet your new productivity assistant! For April Fools' Day, we're introducing Clippy, your friendly (and slightly mischievous) helper. He's here to make your day a little brighter—and maybe a little more chaotic. 😜

Clippy pops up with tips, jokes, and the occasional dance across your dashboard. Don't worry, you can always dismiss him with a click (or just enjoy the nostalgia). 🐤

**Features:**
- 💡 Pops up with helpful (and sometimes unhelpful) tips
- 🕺 Animates across your dashboard with classic Clippy moves
- 😂 Tells a random joke on demand
- ❌ Can be dismissed with a single click
- 🥚 Easter eggs for the curious

**Behind the scenes:** 🎬
Our team had a blast bringing Clippy to life for a day. No productivity assistants were harmed in the making of this feature.

Don't worry, Clippy will only stick around for a day. Or will he? 😉
