🔌 Connect your SaaS workspace to the tools you love! Our new integrations make it easy to automate and extend your workflow, saving you time and reducing manual work.

This release is just the beginning—integrations are now a first-class part of our platform. We've started with the most requested tools and will be adding more based on your feedback. 🗂️

**New integrations:**
- 💬 **Slack:** Get real-time notifications and updates in your channels
- 🐙 **GitHub:** Link commits and pull requests to your projects for better traceability
- 🤖 **Zapier:** Automate repetitive tasks with 5,000+ apps
- 📅 **Google Calendar:** Sync important dates and deadlines

**Behind the scenes:** 🔧
We built a new integrations framework to make adding and managing connections seamless. Our API is now more robust, and we're working on an integrations marketplace for even more options.

More integrations are on the way—tell us which ones you want next! 📨
